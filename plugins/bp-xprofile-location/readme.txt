== Description ==

This plugin works with both BuddyPress and the BuddyBoss Platform. It creates an xProfile Location field type that will use the Google Places API to populate and validate address fields on member profiles.

The result will be *uniform* and *searchable* addresses with a *single* input field.

In BuddyPress, you can create multiple Location fields via *wp-admin > Users > Profile Fields > Add New Field*

In BuddyBoss Platform, you can create multiple Location fields via *wp-admin > BuddyBoss > Profiles > Profile Fields > Add New Field*

The xprofile field for each member will be populated as a searchable string.

A latitude / longitude 'geocode' will be saved as a separate field, if that option was selected when the field was created.

You can then use the geocode in your preferred Member Map solution.

This plugin supports searches, including distance, with:
- the BP Profile Search plugin, version 5.0 or higher
- the BuddyBoss Platform > Profile Search, version 1.4.3 or higher

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a Google Maps API Key? =
Yes. If you need help, read this tutorial: [Google Maps API Key](https://www.philopress.com/google-maps-api-key/ "Google Maps API Key")

= I have a Google Maps API Key. Where do I put it? =

If you use BuddyPress:  Go to wp-admin > Settings > BuddyPress > Options.  Under 'Profile Settings', find 'Google Maps API key', enter your key and Save.

Or if you use BuddyBoss Platform: Go to wp-admin > BuddyBoss > Integrations > PhiloPress. Find 'Google Maps API key', enter your key and Save.

= Why are geocodes sometimes not created? =
If you selected the "Save Geocode" option when creating the profile field and a geocode is not being saved when a member edits that field, then most likely they are not clicking on one of the address options that Google returns as they type.  They have to click on one of the addresses or Goggle will not return the geocode. There is no practical method of forcing them to make that selection. We suggest that the "Description" text of the profile field contain an instruction like: "Please make a selection from the dropdown or you will not appear on the Members Map".
